We want to turn the given integer into a number that
has only one non-zero digit using a tail rounding
approach. This means that at each step we take the
last non 0 digit of the number and round it to 0 or to
10. If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 if it's
larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10 (rounding
to 10 means increasing the next significant digit by 1).
The process stops immediately once there is only one
non-zero digit left.
