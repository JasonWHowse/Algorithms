You're a crossword fanatic, and have finally decided to try
and create your own. However, you also love symmetry and
good design, so you come up with a set of rules they should
follow:
    the crossword must contain exactly four words;
    these four words should form four pairwise intersections;
    all words must be written either left-to-right or
    top-to-bottom;
    the area of the rectangle formed by empty cells inside
    the intersections isn't equal to zero.
Given 4 words, find the number of ways to make a crossword
following the above-described rules. Note that two crosswords
which differ by rotation are considered different.
