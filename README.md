# Algorithms
Each individual class showcases my skills in designing algorithms using good coding practices.

Each class has a corresponding test class design to stress the algorithms to make sure they do what was intended.

The algorithms are practice from the https://app.codesignal.com/ website uploaded to showcase my individual skill.
